# ClimateAI

This was a project that I HAD made a while ago for an Intel AI bootcamp. This is a pyqt5 based GUI application that predicts the weather and the marks scored by students using 
Logistic and Linear Regression. There is also a small AI model made using cosine similarity that calculates the similarity between two sentences, this was the underlying algorithm
used to make the Cosine Similarity AI that I had developed later.
